## Quick Facts

### Design Approach
- **Architecture:** Hybrid (single-table for hot data, separate tables for admin)
- **Total Tables:** 3
  - AlgoItny-Main (provisioned, hot data)
  - AlgoItny-Users (on-demand, user management)
  - AlgoItny-Plans (on-demand, configuration)
- **Total GSIs:** 9 (3 per table)
- **Capacity Mode:** Provisioned with auto-scaling for main table, on-demand for others

### Performance Targets
- **Get problem by ID:** <10ms (p99)
- **Get problem + test cases:** <50ms (p99)
- **List queries:** <100ms (p99)
- **Rate limit check:** <10ms (p99)
- **User history:** <50ms (p99)

### Cost Estimate
- **1,000 DAU:** ~$137/month
- **10,000 DAU:** ~$800/month
- **Current RDS:** ~$50-100/month (but won't scale)

### Migration Timeline
- **Phase 1 (Dual-Write):** 2 weeks
- **Phase 2 (Data Migration):** 2 weeks
- **Phase 3 (Read Migration):** 3 weeks
- **Phase 4 (Write Migration):** 2 weeks
- **Phase 5 (Decommission):** 3 weeks
- **Total:** 7-12 weeks

### Risk Assessment

## Design Highlights

### Table 1: AlgoItny-Main (Single Table Design)

**Entities:** Problem, TestCase, SearchHistory, UsageLog, ScriptGenerationJob

**Key Design Patterns:**
1. **Hierarchical:** Problem + TestCases in one query
2. **Timeline:** User history sorted by time
3. **Daily Tracking:** Usage logs with date prefix for fast daily counts
4. **Sparse Indexes:** Only index public items, active items
5. **TTL:** Auto-delete usage logs after 90 days

**Primary Key Structure:**
```
Problem:        PK=PROBLEM#{platform}#{id}  SK=METADATA
TestCase:       PK=PROBLEM#{platform}#{id}  SK=TESTCASE#{time}#{id}
SearchHistory:  PK=USER#{id}                SK=HISTORY#{time}#{id}
UsageLog:       PK=USER#{id}                SK=USAGE#{date}#{action}#{time}
Job:            PK=JOB#{id}                 SK=METADATA
```

**GSIs:**
- GSI1: Platform/Public/JobType + Time (list by platform, public feed, jobs by type)
- GSI2: Completed/Status + Time (completed problems, jobs by status)
- GSI3: Language/TaskID + Time (filter by language, lookup by task ID)

### Table 2: AlgoItny-Users

**Entities:** User

**Key Design Patterns:**
1. **Email-based PK:** Natural lookup key
2. **OAuth Integration:** GSI for Google ID lookup
3. **Plan Membership:** GSI for filtering users by plan

**Primary Key Structure:**
```
User: PK=USER#{email}  SK=METADATA
```

**GSIs:**
- GSI1: GoogleID lookup (OAuth login)
- GSI2: Plan membership (list users by plan)
- GSI3: UserID lookup (internal ID for foreign keys)

### Table 3: AlgoItny-Plans

**Entities:** SubscriptionPlan

**Key Design Patterns:**
1. **Name-based PK:** Natural lookup key
2. **Active filtering:** GSI for active plans only

**Primary Key Structure:**
```
Plan: PK=PLAN#{name}  SK=METADATA
```

**GSIs:**
- GSI1: Active plans (list active plans for user selection)

---

## Key Design Decisions

### Why Hybrid Approach?

**Single-Table Design for Hot Data:**
- Problems, test cases, history, usage logs accessed together
- User-specific queries benefit from same partition key
- Reduces table count, simplifies management
- Better cost efficiency

**Separate Tables for Admin:**
- User management is security-sensitive (isolation)
- Low-frequency admin operations don't need provisioned capacity
- Simplifies IAM policies
- Easier backup/restore strategies

### Why 3 GSIs per Table?

**Limited by Access Patterns:**
- Each GSI supports specific query pattern
- More GSIs = higher cost
- 3 GSIs cover 95% of queries efficiently
- Remaining 5% use scan with filters (acceptable for admin)

**Cost Optimization:**
- Could use 5-6 GSIs for perfect coverage
- But cost would increase by 60%
- Chose pragmatic middle ground

### Why Denormalization?

**Platform/Title in SearchHistory:**
- Enables filtering without joining Problem table
- Historical accuracy (problem details may change)
- Supports anonymous users (no FK constraint)
- Common pattern in DynamoDB

**Trade-off:**
- Slight redundancy
- Must update if problem changes (rare)

### Why TTL on UsageLog?

**Storage Cost Savings:**
- Usage logs grow indefinitely (50/user/day)
- Without TTL: Infinite growth
- With 90-day TTL: 90 Ã— 50 = 4,500 items per user max
- Reduces storage cost by 90%

**No Downside:**
- Old logs not needed for rate limiting (daily check)
- Analytics can query last 90 days
- Archive to S3 if long-term storage needed

## Migration Strategy Summary

### Phase 1: Dual-Write (Weeks 1-2)
**Goal:** Set up infrastructure without affecting production

**Tasks:**
- Create DynamoDB tables in dev/staging
- Implement repository pattern
- Add dual-write logic (PostgreSQL primary, DynamoDB shadow)
- Enable DynamoDB reads for 10% traffic (feature flag)
- Monitor data consistency

**Success Criteria:**
- 100% write consistency between databases
- No production impact
- DynamoDB reads successful for test traffic

**Rollback:** Disable dual-write, continue PostgreSQL only

### Phase 2: Data Migration (Weeks 3-4)
**Goal:** Backfill historical data

**Tasks:**
- Export all PostgreSQL data
- Transform to DynamoDB format (handle IDs, denormalization)
- Bulk import via BatchWriteItem or S3 import
- Verify data integrity (row counts, spot checks)
- Run read queries against both databases

**Success Criteria:**
- 100% data migrated
- Checksums match
- All queries return identical results

**Rollback:** Delete DynamoDB data, restart migration

### Phase 3: Read Migration (Weeks 5-7)
**Goal:** Gradually shift read traffic

**Tasks:**
- Increase DynamoDB read traffic: 10% â†’ 25% â†’ 50% â†’ 75% â†’ 100%
- Monitor latency (p50, p99, p999)
- Monitor error rates
- Optimize slow queries (add caching, adjust capacity)
- Keep PostgreSQL as fallback

**Success Criteria:**
- 100% reads from DynamoDB
- p99 latency <100ms
- Error rate <0.1%

**Rollback:** Switch back to PostgreSQL reads (feature flag)

### Phase 4: Write Migration (Weeks 8-9)
**Goal:** Make DynamoDB primary

**Tasks:**
- Switch all writes to DynamoDB only
- Stop dual-write logic
- Monitor write latency and errors
- Keep PostgreSQL read-only for 30 days (backup)

**Success Criteria:**
- All writes successful in DynamoDB
- No data loss
- Application functioning normally

**Rollback:** Re-enable dual-write, restore from PostgreSQL

### Phase 5: Decommission (Weeks 10-12)
**Goal:** Complete migration

**Tasks:**
- Export PostgreSQL data for archival (S3 Glacier)
- Shut down PostgreSQL database
- Remove dual-write code
- Clean up feature flags
- Update documentation

**Success Criteria:**
- DynamoDB is sole database
- Code cleaned up
- Team trained on new system

**No Rollback:** Migration complete

## Common Questions

### Q: Why not just scale PostgreSQL with read replicas?
**A:** Read replicas help with read scaling but:
- Don't solve connection limit (still 100-200 per instance)
- Don't help with write scaling
- Add complexity (replication lag, failover)
- More expensive ($500+ per replica)
- Still vertical scaling for writes

### Q: Why not use Aurora Serverless?
**A:** Aurora Serverless has:
- Cold start issues (2-5 seconds)
- Still connection pooling limits
- More expensive than DynamoDB at scale
- Not as globally distributed
- Better for workloads that need SQL

### Q: What about full-text search?
**A:** DynamoDB doesn't support LIKE queries:
- Use Amazon OpenSearch Service (+$30/month)
- Sync data via DynamoDB Streams â†’ Lambda â†’ OpenSearch
- Better search experience than SQL LIKE anyway
- Alternative: ElasticSearch, Algolia

### Q: How do we handle aggregations?
**A:** Three approaches:
1. **Pre-aggregate:** Store counters in items (e.g., execution_count in User)
2. **Streams:** DynamoDB Streams â†’ Lambda â†’ aggregate in real-time
3. **Athena:** Query DynamoDB table exports for ad-hoc analytics

### Q: What if we need complex joins?
**A:** Rethink data model:
- Denormalize common joins (store platform/title in SearchHistory)
- Use GSIs to enable filtering without joins
- For admin queries, scan is acceptable (infrequent)
- Can still use RDS for complex analytics (dual-database)

### Q: How do we test DynamoDB locally?
**A:** Multiple options:
- **DynamoDB Local:** Official AWS local database
- **Moto:** Python library for mocking AWS services
- **LocalStack:** Full AWS mock environment
- **TestContainers:** Docker-based testing

### Q: What about data consistency?
**A:** DynamoDB provides:
- **Eventually consistent reads:** Default (cheaper)
- **Strongly consistent reads:** Available when needed (2x cost)
- **Transactions:** Up to 100 items (higher latency)
- For this app: Eventually consistent is fine for most queries

### Q: How do we rollback if migration fails?
**A:** Multiple rollback points:
- **Phase 1-3:** Feature flag to switch back to PostgreSQL reads
- **Phase 4:** Restore from PostgreSQL backup (kept for 30 days)
- **Phase 5:** Can restore from DynamoDB backup + archived PostgreSQL data
- **All phases:** No data loss (dual-write ensures consistency)
