## Key Findings

### What Works Well for DynamoDB

1. **Time-Series Access Patterns**
   - Almost all queries sort by `created_at DESC`
   - Natural fit for DynamoDB sort keys
   - High read:write ratio favors DynamoDB

2. **Existing Optimization Practices**
   - Heavy use of denormalization already
   - Sophisticated caching layer (Redis)
   - Query optimization with `only()`, `select_related()`, `prefetch_related()`
   - These translate well to DynamoDB patterns

3. **Rate Limiting with Counters**
   - Current implementation counts UsageLogs
   - Perfect for DynamoDB atomic counters
   - Can improve performance with denormalized counters in User table

4. **Write-Once, Read-Many Data**
   - SearchHistory records never updated (except hints)
   - UsageLogs are append-only
   - Ideal for DynamoDB's write-optimized design

### Critical Challenges

1. **Full-Text Search** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Current: `Problem.objects.filter(title__icontains='search')`
   - DynamoDB: No native full-text search
   - **Solution Required:** Amazon OpenSearch integration

2. **Complex OR Queries** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
   - Current: `Q(user=x) | Q(is_code_public=True)`
   - DynamoDB: Requires multiple queries + app-level merge
   - **Solution:** Application-level query orchestration

3. **Database Aggregations** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
   - Current: Django ORM `annotate()`, `aggregate()`
   - DynamoDB: No native GROUP BY
   - **Solution:** Pre-computed aggregates + DynamoDB Streams

4. **Offset Pagination** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
   - Current: `queryset[offset:limit]`
   - DynamoDB: Only cursor-based pagination
   - **Solution:** Refactor frontend to use cursor pagination

5. **Large Transactions** (LOW PRIORITY)
   - Current: Atomic creation of Problem + 100+ test cases
   - DynamoDB: 100 item limit on transactions
   - **Solution:** Batch writes with idempotency

## Recommended DynamoDB Schema

### Table Design: Multi-Table Approach (Recommended)

**7 Tables:**
1. **Users** - Authentication, plans, rate limiting counters
2. **Problems** - Problem metadata with denormalized counts
3. **TestCases** - Separate table with problem_id as partition key
4. **SearchHistory** - Execution records (high volume)
5. **UsageLogs** - Rate limiting audit trail (time-series, TTL)
6. **SubscriptionPlans** - Small reference table (5 records)
7. **ScriptGenerationJobs** - Async job tracking

### Key Design Decisions

**1. Denormalization Strategy**
```
User Item:
  - Includes plan_limits (from SubscriptionPlan)
  - Includes rate_limit_counters (hints_today, executions_today)

SearchHistory Item:
  - Includes user_email, problem_title, platform (from joins)
  - Avoids joins on hot paths
```

**2. GSI Strategy (20+ total across all tables)**
```
Users:
  - EmailIndex (for login)
  - GoogleIdIndex (for OAuth)
  - PlanIndex (for admin queries)

Problems:
  - IdIndex (for ID lookups)
  - PlatformIndex (for filtering)
  - CompletionIndex (for list views)
  - LanguageIndex (for filtering)

SearchHistory:
  - UserHistoryIndex (most common query)
  - PublicHistoryIndex (anonymous browsing)
  - ProblemHistoryIndex (analytics)
```

**3. Rate Limiting Design**
```
UsageLogs Table:
  PK: USER#<id>#<date>
  SK: <timestamp>#<action>
  TTL: 30 days

Query today's usage:
  Query(PK='USER#123#2025-10-07')
  Returns count in single query
```

**4. Search Integration**
```
DynamoDB (source of truth)
    ↓
DynamoDB Streams
    ↓
Lambda Function
    ↓
Amazon OpenSearch
    ↓
Search API
```

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Preparation (3-4 weeks)
- ✅ Access patterns analyzed (DONE)
- Create DynamoDB tables with GSIs
- Set up OpenSearch cluster
- Write migration scripts
- Create data access abstraction layer

### Phase 2: Integration (3-4 weeks)
- Deploy OpenSearch indexing pipeline
- Implement dual-write to both databases
- Add feature flags for gradual rollout
- Test all read/write patterns
- Performance testing and optimization

### Phase 3: Migration (1 week)
- Bulk migrate historical data
- Verify data integrity
- Run parallel testing
- Monitor metrics closely

### Phase 4: Cutover (1-2 days)
- Switch 100% reads to DynamoDB
- Disable PostgreSQL writes
- Monitor for 48 hours
- Keep PostgreSQL as backup

### Phase 5: Cleanup (1 week)
- Remove dual-write code
- Archive PostgreSQL database
- Optimize DynamoDB capacity
- Set up production monitoring

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Data loss | CRITICAL | Low | Dual-write period, backups |
| Search breaks | HIGH | High | Deploy OpenSearch first |
| Performance degradation | HIGH | Medium | Load testing, gradual rollout |
| Cost overruns | MEDIUM | Medium | Start on-demand, optimize |
| Complex queries fail | HIGH | Medium | Rewrite logic, extensive testing |

## Cost Analysis

### Current PostgreSQL Costs (Estimated)
- AWS RDS PostgreSQL (db.t3.medium): ~$50-100/month
- Storage (100GB): ~$10/month
- Backups: ~$10/month
- **Total:** ~$70-120/month

### Expected DynamoDB Costs
- **Tables (On-Demand):** ~$200-400/month
- **GSIs:** ~$50-100/month
- **OpenSearch (small cluster):** ~$50-150/month
- **DynamoDB Streams:** ~$10-20/month
- **Data Transfer:** ~$10-30/month
- **Total Initial:** ~$320-700/month

### After Optimization (3-6 months)
- Switch to provisioned capacity with auto-scaling
- Optimize GSI usage
- Fine-tune OpenSearch cluster
- **Optimized Total:** ~$200-400/month

### Cost-Benefit Trade-offs
- **Higher initial cost** for infrastructure
- **Lower operational overhead** (managed service)
- **Better scalability** without re-architecture
- **Improved performance** (lower latency)
- **Multi-region capability** for global deployment

## Performance Expectations

### Latency Improvements

| Operation | Current (PostgreSQL) | Expected (DynamoDB) | Improvement |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| User login | 30-50ms | 5-15ms | 2-3x faster |
| Get problem + test cases | 50-100ms | 10-30ms | 3-5x faster |
| Rate limit check | 20-40ms | 5-10ms | 2-4x faster |
| Create execution record | 30-50ms | 10-20ms | 2-3x faster |
| List user history | 50-80ms | 15-30ms | 2-3x faster |

### Scalability Improvements
- Current: Single-server PostgreSQL (~1000 req/sec)
- DynamoDB: Virtually unlimited (100,000+ req/sec)
- Auto-scaling: Handles traffic spikes automatically
- Multi-region: Can deploy globally if needed

---

## Recommendation

### Proceed with Migration: YES (with conditions)

**Proceed if:**
- Planning to scale beyond single-server capacity
- Need multi-region deployment
- Want lower operational overhead
- Team is willing to learn DynamoDB patterns
- Budget allows for 2-3x initial cost increase

**Do NOT proceed if:**
- Current PostgreSQL performance is sufficient
- Budget is extremely tight
- Team has no AWS/NoSQL experience
- Need complex analytical queries frequently

### Alternative Considerations

**Instead of DynamoDB:**
1. **Aurora PostgreSQL Serverless** - Easier migration, auto-scaling SQL
2. **Amazon RDS Read Replicas** - Scale reads without re-architecture
3. **Citus (Distributed PostgreSQL)** - Keep SQL, add horizontal scaling

**Hybrid Approach:**
1. Keep PostgreSQL for complex queries
2. Use DynamoDB for hot paths (Users, Rate Limiting)
3. Use OpenSearch for full-text search
4. Best of all worlds, but more complexity
