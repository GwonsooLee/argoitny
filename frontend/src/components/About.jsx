          <h2>Purpose</h2>
          <p>
            Our platform serves multiple key purposes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Automated Test Case Generation:</strong> Automatically generate diverse and comprehensive test cases
              for algorithm problems from popular platforms like Baekjoon and Codeforces.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Code Testing:</strong> Test your solution code against generated test cases in real-time to validate
              correctness and identify edge cases.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Problem Management:</strong> Register, organize, and manage algorithm problems with their test cases
              in one centralized location.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Learning Enhancement:</strong> Improve your problem-solving skills by understanding various test case
              scenarios and edge cases that might not be obvious from problem descriptions alone.
            </li>
          </ul>

            <h3>3. Generate Test Cases</h3>
            <p>
              Once you select a problem, the system will automatically generate test cases based on the problem's constraints
              and requirements. These test cases include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Basic cases covering standard inputs</li>
              <li>Edge cases for boundary conditions</li>
              <li>Corner cases for special scenarios</li>
              <li>Large cases for performance testing</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div className="usage-step">
            <h3>4. Test Your Code</h3>
            <p>
              Write or paste your solution code in the code editor. The platform supports multiple programming languages.
              Click "Run Tests" to execute your code against all generated test cases and see the results instantly.
